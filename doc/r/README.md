# checklist
A checklist for using Github as a project management tool.

In the context of a project management tool Github issues are called user stories.

## Create the user story

* [ ] Create an issue for each user story
* [ ] Add a time estimation label for each user story. **Estimation time = documentation + development + tests** 
* [ ] Add a milestone to the user story to define which sprint the user story belongs to
* [ ] Add a label to prioritize the user story
* [ ] Add other labels to precise the nature of the user story (technical, bug, enhancement,...)

## Work on the user story

* [ ] Assigne someone or yourself when the work on the user story starts
* [ ] Add the label "in progress" to inform your team you are currently working on the user story and to track the time spent on the user story
* [ ] Update the Readme before working on a user story: **what, why, how**
* [ ] Add comments to the user story to describe the progress of your work. Your team will know if you have some problems and will be able help you. Your clients can also see what you are working on and it can help them to understand your work
* [ ] Use Github notification to see if someone add a comment/response/help to your user story
* [ ] If you haven't finished a user story at the end of a day, take 1/2h to add a clear and precise description of the current status of the user story. Anyone should be able to finish the user story jsut by reading the description
* [ ] Each commmits must refere a user story!

## Complete the user story

* [ ] Are all tests passing?
* [ ] Is the coverage still 100%?
* [ ] Increment the version of your app
* [ ] Create a pull request
* [ ] Assign someone to review your pull request
* [ ] Delete the label "in progress"
* [ ] Update the time estimation label if you have to
* [ ] Close the user story and refere the PR which include the user story
* [ ] Write a [blog](https://github.com/dwyl/adoro) or a tutorial to consolidate your learning and to share your tricks!
